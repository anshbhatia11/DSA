## Important Note:
The code in some files may feel incomplete. For ex, in certain C++ codes main() can be missing. This is so because the code was done as problem on any coding platform like LeetCode, GFG etc and hence the system code or the code pre-given or hidden by platform is missing.

Also, the folder categorization is done with best effort but a code can be part of any other folder concept too. The file, even though, will be located in folder concept it suits best.

Code File name consists either the problem statement or the concept it is related to or both.
